# Inspire Girls Academy

This is the source for the Inspire Girls Academy website, a mix of informative content
and team schedules, statistic and league data.

The site uses Next JS and the Vercel Postgresql and Blob services.

In order to update this site you need a little experience with React, though a user
friendly set of admin screens will ultimately be created.

For now some of the pages are easy to edit whilst others are a little more involved.

Teams, leagues and cups are all held in the database and a number of fetchers have
been developed that go to the JPL or Hampshire league websites, get the data and
then insert it into the IGA database to be used to build the webpage.
