          <h2>The Story so far</h2>
          <p>
            After taking a role at Fleet Town Girls &amp; Ladies FC in 2017 IGAs
            found, Darren Moggach, identified the level of local talent, but
            found there was no pathway for those players to continue their
            journey, and ultimately, their dream to play professional football.
            Darren has more recently taken on the role as Chairman for this
            club.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 2 years of research, in 2021 an outline design was produced.
            The idea was to create a community project that would open the door
            for all local talent and build teams to play at the highest
            competitive level available. In addition, pillars would be created
            that would support these players from a technical, physical and
            mental point, which would prepare them for the professional game in
            the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            In November 2021, Darren was introduced to Sophie Hollis from IGF,
            and as they shared the same aspirations, on the back of this design,
            they joined forces and IGF FC was formed. Sophie would Chair the
            project, while Darren took up the role as Community Development
            Officer.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a successful first season, in the summer of 2023 the project
            moved into phase 2. With this, the name was changed to Inspire Girls
            Academy (IGA) and a new committee was formed. Sophie would continue
            to Chair the Project, supported by a new Vice Chair, Treasurer, CWO
            and Secretary.
          </p>
