    bio: `Hello, I'm Erin, and I proudly lead the U13's team at Inspire Girls Academy. My journey
with IGA began from its inception, and I've been immersed in the club's growth and
development since day one.

My coaching philosophy centers on more than just the technical aspects of the game. Drawing
from my own experiences, I'm passionate about instilling confidence in young players. I lost
and regained my love for football, battled through injuries, and emerged stronger. Now, I aim
to empower the girls not only with the skills to excel on the pitch but also with a mindset
that fosters resilience and self-assurance. I find joy in educating the girls on injury prevention,
playing with confidence, proper warm-up routines, and physical strength on the pitch. It's not
just about the game; it's about equipping them with life skills, showing them how to use their abilities
effectively and safely.

Join me and the U13's team at Inspire Girls Academy, where we don't just play football;
we build confidence, resilience, and a love for the game that lasts a lifetime.`,

    title: 'Coach',
    bio: `Having coached girls football for 14 years both in England and in the USA, my coaching
philosophy revolves around a player-centered, or as I prefer, 'needs-centered' approach.
This empowers players to take ownership, fostering both individual and team growth.

I believe in giving players the freedom to make decisions and solve problems, especially
beneficial for younger players who thrive in an environment that encourages expressing
themselves on the pitch. I value the input of each player in training and games, promoting
problem-solving and decision-making.

As a coach, my role is to provide support when needed,
building strong relationships by sharing ideas with the individuals I work with.`,

My passion for football developed from the age of five and even to this day I realised
that football was going to play an integral part in my life and future career pathway.
I have had several setbacks through injury and mental health problems, this has shaped
me into the woman I am today.

Football has had such a positive influence on my life. It has provided me with a sense
of community and confidence that continues to shape my life on and off the pitch.
I have an unrivalled desire to contribute to the future sporting careers of athletes

power to inspire, influence and change the lives of the ones they coach.`,
