        <h2>Player &amp; Parent Code of Conduct</h2>
        <h3>Player Code of Conduct </h3>
        <p>
          IGA is a non-profit football club that was created as a way to
          complement girls&apos; grassroots football by offering an advanced
          set-up that builds positive pathways into women&apos;s football. To
          achieve this, we operate a &apos;player-centred&apos; approach that
          delivers expert coaching and guidance on a more individual technical
          basis, so that every player can learn and develop at their own pace.
          We create a professional environment where our players are encouraged
          to experiment and be creative and have no fear of failure in order to
          develop their game.
