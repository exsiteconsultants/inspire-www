        <h2>The Story so far</h2>
        <p>
          After taking a role at Fleet Town Girls &amp; Ladies FC in 2017 IGAs
          found, Darren Moggach, identified the level of local talent, but found
          there was no pathway for those players to continue their journey, and
          ultimately, their dream to play professional football. Darren has more
          recently taken on the role as Chairman for this club.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 2 years of research, in 2021 an outline design was produced. The
          idea was to create a community project that would open the door for
          all local talent and build teams to play at the highest competitive
          level available. In addition, pillars would be created that would
          support these players from a technical, physical and mental point,
          which would prepare them for the professional game in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          In November 2021, Darren was introduced to Sophie Hollis from IGF, and
          as they shared the same aspirations, on the back of this design, they
          joined forces and IGF FC was formed. Sophie would Chair the project,
          while Darren took up the role as Community Development Officer.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a successful first season, in the summer of 2023 the project
          moved into phase 2. With this, the name was changed to Inspire Girls
          Academy (IGA) and a new committee was formed. Sophie would continue to
          Chair the Project, supported by a new Vice Chair, Treasurer, CWO and
          Secretary.
        </p>
